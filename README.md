## How to play

1.  Run the game with `cargo run`.
2.  Enter the amount you want to bet.
3.  The game will deal you and the dealer two cards each.
4.  You can either "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep your current hand).
5.  The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
6.  If you go over 21, you "bust" and lose the round.
7.  The dealer must hit until their score is 17 or higher.
8.  If the dealer busts, you win.
9.  If neither of you bust, the one with the higher score wins.
10. If you get 21 with your first two cards, you get a "Blackjack" and win 1.5 times your bet.
